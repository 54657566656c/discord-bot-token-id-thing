# discord-bot-token-id-thing

### Description

We are looking for a discord bot to render a token's image on the command of `!view <tokenId>`
This bot should be written in Node.Js.

Please do not hard-code your API key. use `process.env.DISCORD_BOT_KEY`

This request has come from the community.

```Hey I just had a thought. Some other servers that I'm in have a bot where you can tag a specific tokenID from the collection and it'll post it automatically in the channel. For instance using the command #6969 will trigger the bot to post an image of CFA #6969. I think it's a cool feature that enables members to quickly reference a specific CFA, and can be a nice way to inspire conversation. Thanks team```

You should use Web3 to pull from the blockchain, you can use this as inspiration.
